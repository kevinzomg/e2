# Project 1

## Game planning
+ Create an array of 9 numbers
+ Shuffle said array
+ Add up numbers in different orders to get sums of lines
+ Create an array of line labels and line sums
+ Iterate on said array to determine the best selections (highest payout)
+ Have numbers represented by a table in HTML
+ PHP should output its results (point payout, best chosen line, and sum of line) into the HTML

## Outside resources
+ W3Schools PHP (the best) <https://www.w3schools.com/php/>
+ PHP.net Manual https://www.php.net/manual/en/, mostly for arrays
+ <https://tutorialdeep.com/knowhow/use-css-php-echo-add-style/> (extremely useful to help add in the last bit of functionality I wanted)
+ A lot of Googling to brainstorm solutions (all solutions are my own, but I didn't get there without finding the incorrect ones first)

## Notes for instructor
This is my attempt at reverse engineering a minigame called "Mini Cactpot" from the game "Final Fantasy XIV". Normally, the game would have the player select three squares to reveal the hidden numbers and then allow the player to choose a line. I had to automate all of those processes and opted to have the highest possible payout be the outcome.
