## Notes for instructor
There's a pretty good chance there's a bit of redundant/unnecessary code which I would normally clean up but I've run out of time on this project. I'm proud of this one though - I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get 100% of the functionality I wanted using strictly PHP. Original ideas included using a bit of jQuery to implement said functionality, but I was surprisingly able to adapt it to PHP forms.
